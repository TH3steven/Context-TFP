# Context-TFP

## Multimedia (Group Team Free Pizza)
Welcome! This is the repo of TFP (Team Free Pizza), for the 2016 Multimedia Contextproject of the TU Delft.
This product aims to improve the workflow of PolyCast Productions B.V. and is made in their vision.

## Requirements
###Java version
Our software is built in Java and requires **at least Java version 8u65**, but it is recommended to use the latest stable version.
The GUI is built with JavaFX and needs no additional plugins.

###Operating system
The software is made for the Windows operating system and might not work as intended on another OS.

###IDE
This software can be developed with both Eclipse and IntelliJ, though they require a different process to set up.

###Note about preset creation/editing
For now, VLC is required to make the connection to the camera or to the mocked live feed. It is important to have the same VLC version as your java version, e.g. 32bit java requires 32bit VLC, and 64bit java requires 64bit VLC. Also, other systems than Windows are untested and might not work with the current implementation.
